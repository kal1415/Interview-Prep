Modules:

A module is just a file. One script is one module.

JavaScript modules are a way to organize and structure code. They allow developers to break their code into smaller, reusable pieces. You can think about them as smaller pieces of code that you can import and export between different parts of an application.

Benefits:
-More Organized Code
-Code Reusability
-No Naming Conflicts

Types:
-Named export/import
-Default export/import
-Renamed export/import
