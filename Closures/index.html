    <h1>Closures</h1>
    <pre>
    A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
    In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
    This ability of a function to store a variable for further reference even after it is executed is called closure.

const outer = () => {
      const age = "24";
      const inner = () => {
        const name = "babu";
        console.log(name, age);
      };
      return inner;
    };
    
    const result = outer();
    result();</pre
