---------------------------------------------Polyfill for Bind-----------------------------------------------

Polyfill:
-Polyfill is nothing but a fallback for the code written in some different version of javascript so that it becomes compatible with older browsers.

-It is a fallback for a method that is not supported by the browser by default.

Bind:
-Bind is just adding an object with a function and creating a new function so that the new function can be invoked at a later point in time.
