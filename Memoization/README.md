------------------------------------------------Memoization---------------------------------------------

Memoization :

Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

In other words, memoization is a way to speed up a function by storing its previously computed results and returning them instead of recomputing the result whenever the function is called with the same arguments.

Conclusion :

As described above, in JavaScript, a memoized function is a function that remembers the results of previous calls and returns the cached result instead of executing the function again.
